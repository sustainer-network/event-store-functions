#### Once the repo is cloned, search for the keyword `TODO` to fill out the template. There should be no `TODO`'s left over, and this README should be rewritten to reflect relevant information for the new event store functions.

#### The following files are in this template:

### build.json

The automated instructions for testing and deploying this function, and publishing it's documentation. This is interpreted by Google Cloud Build after the trigger is configured.

### doc.json

The documentation that will be published to docs.sustainablenetwork.org through Cloud Endpoints. This follows the OpenAPI specs.

### index.js

This is the body of the function and should just immediately call a function imported from a package.

### test.js

Integration tests for these event store functions.
